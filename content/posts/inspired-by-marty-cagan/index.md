I recently read the book [_Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love_ by Marty Cagan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3323374-inspired).

It really re-shaped how I think about creating and shipping products, so I wanted to consolidate my thoughts. This is _not_ a summary of the book, but a summary of what I personally got out of the book.

# Language is everything

I think the biggest thing I got out of this book is concrete language to describe the process of creating and delivering products. You could say _it's just semantics_, but in this case, the language for me unlocked a whole new way of looking at things.

## Discover before you deliver

Cagan distinguishes product _discovery_ from product _delivery_. Discovery is about:
1. Learning what problems and pain your users and prospects face
1. Learning what solutions solve those problems

Before this book, I lived in the world of delivery, shipping features. Most good engineering teams have tooling, process, and practices around delivery. Having this new word - _discovery_ - made me realize I was focusing on only one side of the coin. Cagan outlines frameworks and resources for getting as good at discovery as you are at delivery.

## Re-thinking risk

The main point of discovery is to mitigate risk. In the delivery world, I primarily think about risk in terms of how likely a new feature is to cause regressions in other parts of the system. However, when it comes to discovering new solutions, there are four main types of risk to mitigate:

1. **Value** The biggest one. Does this solve so much pain for customers that they will use it (and pay money for it)?
1. **Usability** Can users actually realize the value of the feature? Or is it too unclear and difficult?
1. **Feasibility** Is it technically possible within time constraints?
1. **Viability.** Can the solution work for the business? Are there legal issues? Are sales and marketing tooled up to sell it?

For many features, we may know that all four types of risk are minimal from the outset.

However, if there are questions, it is **not** okay to simply implement and learn from usage. The point of discovery is to learn much more quickly and cheaply than the cost of building and shipping.

Once you have a solid discovery process in place, you can build with more confidence and without cluttering your product with low-value features and technical debt.
